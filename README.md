UMN Python API Assignment
This assignment was completed by me with some assistance of the Xpert Learning Assistant. The following sites are used for APIs: Geoapify.com and Openweathermap.com. For the final step in Vacation.py, I could not for the life of me figure out what was wrong with my code that it would not populate hotel names. I kept my code in for the sake of showing my work. Thank you!
